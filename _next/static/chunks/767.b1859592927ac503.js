Hanoi is packed with incredible temples, and a visit to the 11th century Temple of Literature is a must-do activity. The side-by-side Ho Chi Minh Museum and Mausoleum are also major attractions in Hanoi, and both are striking buildings from the exterior.","northPlace2":"Ha Long Bay","northPlace2Explain":"Halong means descending dragons, which is indicative of the silhouette of the limestone outcrops that poke out from the water. Day cruises or overnight boat trips are a spectacular way to experience the beauty of Halong Bay and to see as many of the islands as possible.","northPlace3":"Sapa","northPlace3Explain":"The mountainous town of Sapa is known for its culturally diverse population as well as its proximity to incredible scenery. Sapa itself is home to the members of many hill tribes, including the Hmong, the Dao, the Muong and the Tay. The town also overlooks the magnificent Muong Hoa Valley and its terraced rice fields, which are staggering to behold","northPlace4":"Tam Coc","northPlace4Explain":"On paper, Tam Coc can be described as rice paddies surrounded by limestone cliffs and rock formations. In reality, Tam Coc is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful destination in the entire region. The best way to explore is by boat, and you can set off on a rowboat that takes you up alongside the lush green paddies and between striking limestone cliffs. You’ll even float through three tunnels that run through the mountains, which were carved over time by the river itself. From your boat, vendors may tempt (or deter) you with local souvenirs and handicrafts.","northPlace5":"Cat Ba Island","northPlace5Explain":"In Vietnam’s Halong Bay is the Cat Ba Archipelago. While the archipelago boasts more than 360 islands, the largest is titled Cat Ba. Although there are many beautiful places to explore on the island, Cat Ba town is not among these, with its low-rise concrete hotels along a once-lovely bay. Fortunately, more than 50 percent of the island is a national park, which was created to protect the rare Cat Ba Langur, an adorable but difficult-to-spot primate. If you’re not able to spot any langurs, take a ferry over to Monkey Island. There, macaques are in abundance.","northPlace6":"Bai Tu Long Bay","northPlace6Explain":"Bai Tu Long Bay is adjacent to Halong, and it also boasts a sinking limestone plateau, gorgeous blue waters and an abundance of small islands. In fact, many people prefer Bai Tu Long Bay because it is far less crowded than its more popular neighbor to the south. The best way to tour Bai Tu Long Bay is by boat, and there are any number of cruises that can take you to the highlights throughout the bay."}')}}]);
